# Make sure to set appropriate secrets to allow auto-rendering to happen. 
# This can be done via settings > secrets > actions menus.
# Key should be generated in json format via the https://console.cloud.google.com/
# interface, by creating a key that can be used by a Google Service Account.

# Note that credentials need to be created in the pull_request.yml or 
# render-all.yml workflows first. Any Google Sheets in question must also be 
# shared with the Google Service Account.
